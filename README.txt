External Libraries:
My implementation does not use any external libraries

Improvements to current design:
-One of the shortcomings of my implementation is the activity does not show up until the API call has been made and all images have been downloaded. This can surely be fixed by updating the UI from the onPostExecute method of AsyncTask as and when content is loaded. 
-There is little to no error handling and string constants should be declared in a separate class or in strings.xml.
-External library such as Volley could have been used for HTTP requests.
-Code could have been a little cleaner.
